# Resistance in and Beyond Public Space 

Mass protest in public space is often situated as the normative mode of resistance in contemporary states. In Palestine, the potential of public space to provide such a site is limited, given decades of colonisation, oppressive planning and policing and especially the problem of identifying the ‘public’. Studying resistance in Palestine through and beyond the frame of public space sheds light on the limitations of coupling resistance and public space while providing inspiration for resistance acts in varied site types. 

## Key Questions
- How have Palestinians used the material and symbolic power of space to make political claims? 
- How does the pervasiveness of colonial expansion and infrastructure multiply sites of resistance? 

## Key Cases
- Land Day
- Great March of Return
- 1st Intifada
- resistance in refugee camps
- resistance on apartheid infrastructure
