# Resistance in and Beyond Public Space 

Mass protest in public space is often situated as the normative mode of resistance in contemporary states. This was emphasised in 2011 when mass revolutionary protest emerged in large-scale public spaces in capital cities across the Arab region. In Palestine, this overlap of public space and resistance is interrupted. Decades of colonisation, oppressive planning and policing, and the permanence of refugee populations have troubled notions of what constitutes the “public” and its representation in spaces designed and managed by the state. Studying public space and resistance in Palestine sheds light on the limitations and potentials of coupling these concepts, while providing inspiration for resistance acts in varied site types. 

## Key Questions
- In what ways is public space a site of resistance in contexts of colonisation and domination?
- How does colonial expansion, through the built and natural environments, multiply sites of resistance? 
- How have Palestinians used the material and symbolic power of different kinds of public space to make political claims? 


## Key Cases
- 1936 Revolt
- Land Day
- 1st and 2nd Intifadas
- Great March of Return 
- Public space in Palestinian cities
- Resistance in refugee camps
- Resistance on apartheid infrastructure
