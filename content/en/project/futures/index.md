After the signing of the Oslo Accords, the 1990s saw a steady erosion of a Palestinian political project of territorial liberation and political emancipation. Radical politics and social imaginaries were replaced with a relentless integration into global neoliberalism. Simultaneously, the two-state solution was declared dead multiple times, and Palestinian calls for a one-state solution were revived. But as climate change looms over the region, the future looks more precarious than ever, prompting a search for futures that assert the position of Palestine in relation to its regional context. Meanwhile, a rich preoccupation with alternative futurities abound: from speculative fiction and artwork, to endeavours of archiving and imagining a decolonial future beyond the violence of settler colonialism, to questions of social reproduction and embodied futurities.

## Key Questions
- How are Palestinians imagining and planning for alternative futures for Palestine? 
- How desirable are such futures, given the fragmentation of the Palestinian people? 
- What are the social, political, and economic formations that those futures (re)produce? 
- How do we forge pathways for reaching the desired futures of Palestine?
